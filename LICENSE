A USB/IP device plugin for Kubernetes

You may use, modify and redistribute this software
under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2.0.

Note: the decision to distribute this project under GPL 2.0-only
was purely driven by the fact that it includes code from userspace
utilities from the Linux kernel tree to interface with the VHCI
driver. These are GPL 2.0-only, so applying that license to the
whole project was easy.

If I ever find the time and motivation to replace these utilities with a
pure Go implementation, I might relicense the project more permissively.
To allow for that change to happen smoothly, all outside contributions
are required to dual-license under GPL 2.0-only and Apache 2.0.


See LICENSE.GPL2 for the full text of the GPL 2.0, and
LICENSE.generic-device-plugin for the original licence of
generic-device-plugin, from which this project borrows heavily.
